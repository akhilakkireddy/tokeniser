As a follow-up to the ‘Meet Your Alumni’ initiative, the IIIT-H Alumni Cell would like to introduce you to a very distinguished alumni, Nirupam Pratap, who we had an opportunity to interview about his experiences both during and after college.

Passing out from the CSE course in 2005, Nirupam Pratap was part of the Bing team at Microsoft for six years before doing his MBA from IIM-A, and then moved on to Amazon, where he is currently working as Product manager. In this candid interview, he talks about his college life (when there were no active clubs), his experience at IIM-A, his two-pence on MBA and entrepreneurship, the kind of skills and profile required to get a seat at a top B-school, and also about the differences between MBA pursued in India and pursued abroad.
